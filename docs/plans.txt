Frontend:
1. (DONE) Translate links: from Telegram links to internal routing
2. Add/remove tags
3. Change title
4. Display: Publication time
5. Publishing ability
6. Remove Cut-off (emojis, "Продолжение...")
7. Types, linter,...
8. Subscribers page: interval choice is unnecessary

Backend:
1. New post - extract tags and title
2. Scheduling for updates (further: variadic intervals: after new post increase update frequency for some time)
3. Skip empty updates

Data management:
1. Migration
2. New schema
3. Multi tenancy (multiple telegram channels, multiple social media platform: Threads, Instagram,...)
4. Tag/title source: own model, user, ChatGPT,...
5. Database dump and restore
6. Separate diff tables?
7. Unwind metrics into multiple scalar records
8. Sparse data: don't store single metric value if not changed

AI:
1. Train models, improve quality (define quality); Tags quality is low, doesn't handle russian language cases well
2. Integrate with ChatGPT

Technical debt:
 1. Tests (unit + integration)
 2. API definitions - unify DTOs between backend and frontend
 3. Mix of database tuples and DTOs in backend code
 4. Migrate to a dedicated repository
 5. Hardcoded hosts, hardcoded channel name
 6. Update loop with telegram client seems weird
 7. CORS?
 8. Concurrency for update tasks
 9. Prints to logs
10. Parallel updates?
11. Split update jobs for different posts?

Infrastructure:
1. Containerize. Docker compose, Swarm, or k8s?
2. GitHub actions to build (take care of secrets)
3. Observability: RPMs, logs

Documentation:
1. Architecture
2. Use cases
3. Visualize this list (issue & feature tracker) somewhere
