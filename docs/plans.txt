Frontend:
1. (DONE) Translate links: from Telegram links to internal routing
2. (DONE) Add/remove tags
3. (DONE) Change title
4. Display: Publication time
5. Publishing ability
6. Remove Cut-off (emojis, "Продолжение...")
7. Types, linter,...
8. Subscribers page: interval choice is unnecessary
9. Default url - / to redirect to /reactions

Backend:
1. New post - extract tags and title
2. Scheduling for updates (further: variadic intervals: after new post increase update frequency for some time)
3. Skip empty updates
4. Health/heartbeat/status endpoints, liveness probes
5. Base.metadata.create_all(engine) - dangerous (see: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-692c9be86bfc8191ba382b3404b6c3ae-social-media-metrics/c/692c259f-b344-8330-8d0a-bfca9a913248)
6. Move session to a volume?

Data management:
1. Migrations (Alembic?)
2. New schema
3. Multi tenancy (multiple telegram channels, multiple social media platform: Threads, Instagram,...)
4. Tag/title source: own model, user, ChatGPT,...
5. Database dump and restore
6. Separate diff tables?
7. Unwind metrics into multiple scalar records
8. Sparse data: don't store single metric value if not changed
9. Tags & title: source & soft-delete

AI:
1. Train models, improve quality (define quality); Tags quality is low, doesn't handle russian language cases well
2. Integrate with ChatGPT

Technical debt:
 1. Tests (unit + integration)
 2. API definitions - unify DTOs between backend and frontend
 3. Mix of database tuples and DTOs in backend code
 4. Migrate to a dedicated repository
 5. Hardcoded hosts, hardcoded channel name
 6. Update loop with telegram client seems weird
 7. CORS?
 8. Concurrency for update tasks
 9. Prints to logs
10. Parallel updates?
11. Split update jobs for different posts?
12. Responses from API
13. Cleanup
14. Use Axios instead of FetchAPI (why?)
15. Data sanitization
16. Remove unused fields
17. Metrics & observability
18. Code cleanup
19. Batch save complete flag
20. Frontend: error handling (unified)
21. Frontend: types and issues reported
22. Frontend: Linter
23. Frontend: Tests
24. Frontend: folder structure

Infrastructure:
1. Containerize. Docker compose, Swarm, or k8s?
2. GitHub actions to build (take care of secrets)
3. Observability: RPMs, logs
4. Metrics & observability
5. Database metrics

Performance
1. Aggregated queries: get post metrics page data
2. Pagination for queries
3. Async use of postgres?
4. WARNING: Security error while unpacking a received message: Too many messages had to be ignored consecutively

Issues:
 1. (Fixed) Some failures on new post (see scratch_5)
 2. Errors for comments to posts 1 & 2
 3. Include new posts in reactions
 4. (Fixed) Async is not working properly
 5. (Fixed) Logging? Doesn't work properly
 6. Concurrent updates
 7. (Fixed) Duplicated logs
 8. Reaction counts are wrong
 9. Async workers cleanup seems to be wrong still
10. (Error) See scratch_6
11. Locks? Parallel updates?

Documentation:
1. Architecture
2. Use cases
3. Visualize this list (issue & feature tracker) somewhere

Features:
1. Calendar for posts
2. Heatmap (posts, comments, views, reactions) per period - day, week, month
3. Number of posts (comments, views, reactions) per day - graphs
4. Subscribers list display + diff display
5. Build derived views: e.g. daily totals (background jobs)
6. Forwards counts
7. AI: normalize tags: remove word cases in russian
